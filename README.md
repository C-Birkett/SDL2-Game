# SDL2-Game
A simple game engine that I worked on in Summer 2021

It features an entity component system, and loading of tiled sprite 'levels'

While I never took it forward into making a game, it was a fun experience making
a simple engine and I may pick it up again in the future.

As it stands it's pretty sparse...
